Ask a question and an answer you will receive!

This magic 8 ball has 3 answer types 'affirmative', 'non-committal, and 'negative' responses.
It will randomly pick one of those list types and then randomly pick one of the responses from that list.
This ensures an equal chance to get each type of answers despite and unequal amount of responses in each list.
